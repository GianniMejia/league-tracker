# tournament-tracker

Tournament Tracker is an online application that allows users to keep track of tournaments they wish to create. For example, if sombody wants to have their own personal tracker of the World Cup they can enter the teams they wish to track and update winners, loosers, and scores. Another example would be if the user wanted to host a video game tournament, this application would allow the host to keep track of who is winning and loosing along with the scores of each match. 
After the user signs up, they are then prompted with the ability to start a tournament. After creating the tournament the user has the ability to enter participants, matches, and the date of the matches.
